# sqlalchemy-challenge


- I consulted OpenAI ChatGPT for debugging and formatting help, mostly while working with Flask. It assisted me with the code I used to calculate the date one year from the last date in the Exploratory Precipitation Analysis portion of the assignment as well as the code I used in the Flask portion of the project to create dictionaries in each route. 

- The Exploratory Station Analysis portion of this project was completing during a session with my tutor Kourt Bailey.

- I consulted the AskBCS Learning Assistant for help getting started with the <start> and <start>/<end> routes and some clarification on the active station query.
